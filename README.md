<h1>I'm Dawid [DeVinczi] ðŸš€</h1>

<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to my corner of the coding universe! I'm a passionate software developer with a knack for leveraging the power of C#, .NET, Blazor, and some Docker to build innovative solutions. With over a year of hands-on experience, I've dived into the realms of code, constantly learning and evolving.</p>

<p><strong>What I Bring to the Table</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Docker:</strong> I thrive on Dockerizing applications, harnessing its containerization prowess to streamline deployment and scalability. Building robust, containerized solutions is my forte. My last project was preparing a containerized Chromium with WebApi.</li>
  <li><strong>Crafting with C#:</strong> My journey in software development revolves around C#. I take pride in creating clean, efficient, and scalable code, shaping applications that stand tall amidst challenges. In my daily work, I use design patterns and build whole sites from scratch.</li>
  <li><strong>Blazor:</strong> Blazor is my playground for crafting interactive, feature-rich web applications. I'm deeply entrenched in exploring its capabilities and pushing its boundaries.</li>
</ul>
