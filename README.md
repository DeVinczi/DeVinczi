Hello, World! I'm Dawid [DeVinczi] ðŸš€
About Me
Welcome to my corner of the coding universe! I'm a passionate software developer with a knack for leveraging the power of C#, .NET, Blazor, and some Docker to build innovative solutions. With over a year of hands-on experience, I've dived into the realms of code, constantly learning and evolving.

What I Bring to the Table
Docker Dynamo: I thrive on Dockerizing applications, harnessing its containerization prowess to streamline deployment and scalability. Building robust, containerized solutions is my forte. 
My last project was preparing a contenerized Chromium with WebApi.

Crafting with C#: My journey in software development revolves around C#. I take pride in creating clean, efficient, and scalable code, shaping applications that stand tall amidst challenges. 
In my daily work I use design patterns and build whole sites from scratch.

Blazor Brilliance: Blazor is my playground for crafting interactive, feature-rich web applications. I'm deeply entrenched in exploring its capabilities and pushing its boundaries.
